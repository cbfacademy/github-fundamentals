Since the beginning of the course, I’ve learned a lot, such as the difference between Git and Github I learned the different Git commands and how to use them to manage files. 
I learned how to create a repository and how to work on it locally and remote, creating branches and their specifics (git branch, git checkout, git checkout -b..), 
how to stage using git add, then to perform git commit to register changes and after that, git push to send these changes to the remote repository. 
Finally, I learned that if I'm working with other people, always do git pull first, in case they have made any changes to the remote repository there won't be conflicts when I perform the git push. This final part, 
about git push and git pull, pull request…is not totally consolidated for me yet, but I believe that with practice I will learn better.
