# **What I have learnt** 

## Command line

- How to add directories : ``` mkdir ```
- How to change to specific working directory : ``` cd (diretory name)```
- How to change to directory above where you are (parent folder) : ```cd ..```
- Print working direcotry : ```pwd``` 
- How to add files : ```echo > (file name)```
- How to show list of files within directory :  ```dir (directory name)```
- Deleting a directory : ``` rd / s (course name) ```
- Show content of a file ``` type (file name) ```
- Deleting a file ``` del (file name) ```
- Move a file ``` move (example.txt/exampledirectory) ```

## Git commands

*Some basic git commands are*

```
git init 
git add
git commit
git status
git help
git push
git pull
```

``` git fetch``` * sees all changes applied in local repo and megers changes to current branch *

```git restore``` * discrad changes that are working in directory *


## Git branch commands - *allows to freely work on source code w/o affecting anyone elses work or actual code in main branch*

```checkout - b (branch name)``` *creates a new branch will all git history of branch that currently on and switches to it*

``` git branch ``` * will display all branches you currently have for your repo *

## Java keywords

``` public ```
``` class ```
``` static ```
``` voic ``` 
all cant be changed 

## Git hub terminology 

- Respository
- Branches - isolate work you done want to merge 
- Forks - allows free experitation of projects without affecting original project (different from branches) , popular with open source software projects 
- Pull requests
- Naming file .md allows for markdown editing for files such as READMES


## Various frameworks for software development 

### Waterfall (release project after all testing complete , each new phase only begins when previous is complete) 

### Agile - sprints , kanban (constant evaluation , every project handled differently , small changes constantly)




# **What I am struggling to learn**

- The difference between Java variables, syntax, class
- How the above applies to software , app , web dev etc
- Programming principles and how they apply in practice
- Phrases such as class based , constant , scope , main method
- Java platform

  

# **What I have overcome so far**

- Learning command line it was difficult to remember commands for mac vs windows
- Thinking it is about memorising all the different commands and coding language  rather then understanding what you are trying to do and how you are going to achieve it (google / javadocs be your best friend)
- Applying  myself and encouraing myself to keep going, stay focused on the end goal and be willing to admit when I dont understand something


## **Attach print screens of diagrams explainimg theorys, java variables , concepts etc**

# Questions from first skills test ; java basic , command line , git 

19 out of 22 86.36%

1. *Java code is complied into an intermediate format called?* Archiecture Neurual Byte Codes
   
2. *Which of the following are benefits of Java?*
   
- WORA: WRITE ONCE RUN ANYTIME
- SECURITY? 
- OBJECT ORIENTATION
- ITS FREE
  
3. *A specification of the API : Interface and required behaviour is defined by the?* Java Community Process (JCP)

I struggled most on Java basics and had to research teminology used in the questions
