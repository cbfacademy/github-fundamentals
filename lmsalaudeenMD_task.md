## GitHub Fundamentals Task - LM Salaudeen
I'm creating this markdown file to give an outline of what I've learned and what I'm confused about 

### What I've learned so far
- creating a repo on github
- creating a profile README
- creating a directory on my PC and initializing it with `git init`
- linking my github repo and PC repo
- forking a repo
- pushing and fetching
- adding files, and commiting changes
- etc.
  
### I'm confused about (_might not be relevant_): 
- Currently confused about adding a reviewer to review my pull request. The [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) says I have to have write access to the repository; and I don't think I have write access to the CBF's [Github Fundamentals](https://github.com/cbfacademy/github-fundamentals) repo.
  
### What I'm looking forward to
- Everything! Looking forward to getting started with Java (slightly terrified as well) and building stuff ...
